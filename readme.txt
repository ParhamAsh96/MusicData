I did not submit my work in October because I didn’t have any group and enough time to work on the project. 
With that said, everything in this re-submission is new and built from scratch.

--- Note ---
Libraries:
--> requests (sending requests to web api)
--> json (reading, writing and parsing json files)
--> os (removing json files)

APIs:
--> Spotify


Questions:
--> Music for Motivation – Popular Playlists for Sports Enthusiasts
Refined Question: What are the key musical characteristics (e.g., tempo, energy, danceability) of songs in 
Spotify's most popular workout playlists, and how do they align with 
different types of workouts (e.g., cardio, strength training)?
