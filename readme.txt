This is a personal project created as part of my first-year coursework in Software Engineering and Management at the University of Gothenburg. The project leverages multiple public APIs to answer fun and engaging questions about music artists while helping users explore data visualization and even learn English through lyrics.

## 📌 Project Goals

This project was built to answer the following questions:

1. **Which artist is more popular?**  
   → Choose two artists from a predefined list and compare their Spotify popularity score.

2. **How many times was the artist searched this year?**  
   → Select an artist and view their monthly Wikipedia search statistics in a line chart.

3. **Wanna learn English in a fun way?**  
   → Pick a song from your favorite artist, and the app will return a random word from the lyrics with a simple definition!

## 🛠️ Features & Functionality

- Compare Spotify popularity scores of two artists.
- Visualize monthly Wikipedia search frequency for selected artists.
- Play a lyrics-based game to learn new English vocabulary.
- Simple command-line interface for user interaction.
