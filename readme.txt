I did not submit my work in October because I didn’t have any group and enough time to work on the project. 
With that said, everything in this re-submission is new and built from scratch.


--- Note ---
Libraries:
--> requests (sending requests to web api)
--> json (reading, writing and parsing json files)
--> os (removing json files)
--> matplotlib (diagram)
--> pandas (not sure yet but it's a requarement for wikipedia api)


APIs:
--> Spotify
--> Wikipedia
--> Lyrics


Questions:
--> Q1. User choose some artists from the json list and compare their data to each other'

--> Q2. User get option between some words to get know about the context like 
        if the song is hateful or lovley (Mahboob tarin ahang shad ast ya ghamgin?)
        
--> Q3. User get recommendations based on the user's favorite song
