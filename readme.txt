I did not submit my work in October because I didnâ€™t have any group and enough time to work on the project. 
With that said, everything in this re-submission is new and built from scratch.


Questions:
--> Q1. Which artist is more populuar (Choose two)?

--> Q2. How many times was the artist searched this year? (By month)
        
--> Q3. Wanna learn english in a fun way?
