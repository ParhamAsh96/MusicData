Odds against Nas are slaughter\n\nThinking a word best describing my life to name my daughter\n\nMy strength, my son, the star, will be my resurrection\n\nBorn in correction. All the wrong shit I did, he'll lead a right direction\n\n\"How you living?\" Large, a broker charge - cards are mediocre\n\nYou flipping coke or playing spit spades and strip poker?\n\n\n\nWhose world is this?\n\n(The world is yours, the world is yours)\n\nIt's mine, it's mine, it's mine\n\nWhose world is this?\n\nIt's yours\n\nIt's mine, it's mine, it's mine\n\nWhose world is this?\n\n(The world is yours, the world is yours)\n\nIt's mine, it's mine, it's mine\n\nWhose world is this?\n\n\n\nI'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed\n\nFor murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded\n\nBorn alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne\n\nI'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home\n\nI need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow\n\nCause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow\n\nTrying to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip\n\nPicturing my peeps, now the income make my heartbeat skip\n\nAnd I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs\n\nHeaded for Indiana, stabbing women like the Phantom\n\nThe crew is lamping, Big Willie-style\n\nCheck the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild\n\nStash through the flock wools, burning dollars to light my stove\n\nWalk the blocks with a bop, checking dames, plus the games\n\nPeople play, bust the problems of the world today"
