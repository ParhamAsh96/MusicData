Be the real love that I need\r\nReal love, I'm searching for a real love\n\nSomeone to set my heart free\n\nReal love, I'm searching for a real love\n\nI'm out to have a real love\n\n\n\nWhen I met you I just knew that you would take my heart and run\n\nUntil you told me how you loved for me, you said I'm not the one\n\nSo I slowly came to see all of the things that you were made of\n\nAnd now I hope my dreams and inspiration lead me towards a real love\n\n\n\nReal love, I'm searching for a real love\n\nSomeone to set my heart free\n\nReal love, I'm searching for a real love\n\nI'm out to have a real love\n\n\n\nLove so true, and oh baby, I thought that love was true\n\nI thought that you were the answer to the question in my mind\n\nBut it seems that I was wrong, if I stay strong maybe I'll find a\n\nReal love\n\n\n\nSo I've tried my best and prayed to God He'll send me someone real\n\nTo caress me and to guide me towards a love my heart can feel\n\nNow I know I can be faithful, I can be your all and all\n\nIll give you good lovin' through the summertime, winter, spring and fall\n\n\n\nReal love, I'm searching for a real love\n\nSomeone to set my heart free\n\nReal love, I'm searching for a real love\n\nI'm out to have a real love\n\n\n\nReal love, I'm searching for a real love\n\nSomeone to set my heart free\n\nReal love, I'm searching for a real love\n\nI'm out to have a real love\n\n\n\nSee I'm searching for a real love and I don't know where to go\n\nBeen around the world and high and low and still I never know\n\nHow it feels to have a real love cause it seems it's not around\n\nGotta end it in this way cause it seems he can't be found\n\n\n\nReal love, I'm searching for a real love\n\nSomeone to set my heart free\n\nReal love, I'm searching for a real love\n\nI'm out to have a real love\n\n\n\nReal love, I'm searching for a real love\n\nSomeone to set my heart free\n\nReal love, I'm searching for a real love\n\nI'm out to have a real love"
